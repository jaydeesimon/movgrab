# What is this?

Very rough attempt to detect the presentation slides from a movie (mp4, mov, etc) and extract them into a pdf.

Use case: A friend of mine is taking an online course but the instructor won't release the slides. Since the slides are mostly static frames, we're going to create a screencast of the presentation using Quicktime and then hopefully feed that file to this program and extract the slides.
